                        <p class="text-xl font-medium " >NoSQL databases like MongoDB are a good choice when your data is document-centric and doesn't fit well into the schema of a relational database, when you need to accommodate massive scale, when you are rapidly prototyping, and a few other use cases. <br />
                            MongoDB is the most popular of the new breed of non-relational NoSQL databases. Specifically, it's a document database, also called a document-oriented database or a document store. <br />
                            Document structures usually align with objects that developers are working with in code, which is a more flexible approach than the row-and-column table-oriented structure of a relational database. Developers can rework document (data) structures as their application requirements change over time. With this approach, data structures become like code â€” both are under developers' control.</p>

                        <p class="text-xl font-medium " > Node.js is an open-source server side runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.

                            Micro-Services-based architecture lets you split your application into small units. Each part can independently deploy and scale; it does not matter if different programming languages and teams write it. You can also test the small units individually.

                            is the greatest tool for building real-time web applications. It provides cross-platform applications which run easily on any web. So you basically don't need anything extra for running up a node application. You only need for making one. </p>

                            <br />
                            A JWT is a mechanism to verify the owner of some JSON data. It's an encoded, URL-safe string that can contain an unlimited amount of data (unlike a cookie) and is cryptographically signed. When a server receives a JWT, it can guarantee the data it contains can be trusted because it's signed by the source</p>

                        <h1 class="card-title underline">How does it work</h1>
                        <p class="text-xl font-medium " > JWTs differ from other web tokens in that they contain a set of claims. Claims are used to transmit information between two parties. What these claims are depends on the use case at hand. For example, a claim may assert who issued the token, how long it is valid for, or what permissions the client has been granted.
                            <br />
                            A JWT is a string made up of three parts, separated by dots (.), and serialized using base64. In the most common serialization format, compact serialization, the JWT looks something like this: xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz. </p>
